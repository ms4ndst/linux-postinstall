# in Solaar is what actually fixes it after every reboot, so this replicates
# that exact off-then-on sequence automatically at login instead of just
# setting it to 1 (which can be a no-op if Solaar's cached state already
# reads true even though the mouse itself isn't honoring it). Retries for up
# to 20s since the mouse may not have finished reconnecting over Bluetooth
# yet by the time sway starts.
